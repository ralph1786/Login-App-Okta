# Login-App-Okta
This is a login app built with react, bootstrap and react-okta.
The create-react-app was used to create the base of the project.
In regards to bootstrap it's cdn was used and placed in the index.html inside the public folder.
To use okta we used two dependencies:
    @okta/okta-react
    @okta/okta-signin-widget
Which were installed using npm(must have node.js installed on computer).
